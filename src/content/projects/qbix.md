## Custom WordPress-powered website

This project is a bespoke website created for Qbix. It was built from the ground up to provide a professional, unique digital presence, moving away from generic templates in favor of a high-quality, custom-coded solution.

### 🎯 Project Goals
The main objective was to deliver a "Pixel Perfect" implementation based on professional graphic designs provided in .psd format. The focus was on high attention to detail, full responsiveness (RWD) and ensuring the client has total control over the content through a lightweight and fast backend. The website needed to be fast and performant, with a focus on SEO and accessibility.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, JavaScript & jQuery, SCSS, BEM methodology, Bootstrap CSS
* **Backend:** Custom WordPress theme (PHP), Advanced Custom Fields (ACF Pro), Custom Post Types
* **Integrations:** Contact Form 7 with custom styling

### 🌟 Key Features & Technical Highlights

#### 1. Custom WordPress theme
I developed a completely unique WordPress theme from scratch, ensuring that the final product is not only lightweight and fast but also perfectly aligned with the brand's visual identity. No page builders were used, resulting in clean and maintainable code.

#### 2. Full editorial control (ACF Pro)
I implemented a flexible content management system using ACF Pro. This allows even non-technical staff to easily update text, images, and layout elements through the WordPress admin panel without any risk of breaking the site's structure.

#### 3. Responsive & pixel-perfect implementation
The project required a precise translation of .psd designs into a functional website. I focused on high-quality CSS architecture to ensure that every element, margin, and typography choice remains consistent across all screen sizes and devices.

### 💡 Challenges & Solutions

* **Fidelity and performance:** The challenge was to maintain the high visual quality of the designer's vision while keeping the site's performance optimal. By using SCSS and a custom-coded theme instead of heavy plugins, I achieved a fast-loading site with professional, smooth-running code.
* **Long-Term reliability:** The website was built with stability in mind. By using a solid architecture and proven tools like ACF Pro and Custom Post Types, I delivered a robust solution that remains reliable and easy to maintain for years after the initial launch.
