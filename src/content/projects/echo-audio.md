### The Challenge
Audiophiles demand the highest quality audio, but streaming large lossless files is difficult. We needed a solution that could deliver high-fidelity audio with low latency.

### The Solution
We used **Rust** and **WASM** to build a custom audio processing engine that runs in the browser. This allowed us to implement complex DSP algorithms without the performance overhead of JavaScript.
