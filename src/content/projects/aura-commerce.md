### The Challenge
**Aura Commerce** aimed to set a new standard for headless e-commerce. The client wanted a "score 100" Lighthouse site that also featured rich media, smooth transitions, and complex product variations.

Most e-commerce sites suffer from "bloat" due to third-party scripts and unoptimized assets. Our goal was to create a zero-compromise experience.

### The Solution
We used **Shopify Storefront API** as the backend but built a completely custom frontend using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.

Key highlights:
*   **Static Generation (SSG)** for all product pages to ensure instant initial load.
*   **Edge Middleware** for personalization and localization.
*   **Optimized Image Loading** using next/image with aggressive caching policies.

We achieved a consistent **99/100 performance score** on mobile, significantly improving conversion rates.
