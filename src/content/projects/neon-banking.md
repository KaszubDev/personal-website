### The Challenge
Neon Banking needed a mobile app that felt extremely responsive and trustworthy. Security was paramount, but we didn't want to sacrifice user experience for it.

### The Solution
We built the app entirely in **SwiftUI**, using **Combine** for reactive state management. We implemented **CoreML** on-device to categorize transactions without sending sensitive data to the cloud.
