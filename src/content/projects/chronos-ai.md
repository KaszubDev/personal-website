### The Challenge
Professionals waste hours each week scheduling meetings and finding time for deep work. Chronos AI aimed to solve this by automating calendar management.

### The Solution
We built a robust backend using **FastAPI** and **Python**, with a **PostgreSQL** database to store user schedules. The AI model was trained on thousands of calendars to predict the best times for meetings.
