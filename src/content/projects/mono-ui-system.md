### The Challenge
Creating a component library that is both flexible and opinionated is a difficult balance. We wanted to provide a set of components that looked great out of the box but could be easily themed to fit any brand.

### The Solution
We used **Emotion** for CSS-in-JS styling, allowing for dynamic theming capabilities. We also implemented a strict accessibility strategy, ensuring all components are WAI-ARIA compliant.
