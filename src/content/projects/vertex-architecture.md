### The Challenge
Vertex Architecture wanted a portfolio that reflected their innovative designs. They needed a website that could display 3D models of their buildings directly in the browser.

### The Solution
We used **Three.js** to render 3D models and **GSAP** for smooth scroll animations. The site is a seamless experience that showcases their work in a way that static images never could.
