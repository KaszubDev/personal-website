## Educational school trips directory

This project is a comprehensive search and booking platform for school trips and educational tours. It focuses on presenting a massive database of travel offers in an intuitive, easy-to-navigate manner.

### 🎯 Project Goals
The primary objective was to create a centralized hub for educational travel. The platform needed to handle hundreds of unique offers across different categories, providing users with a fast and efficient way to find the perfect school trip.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, JavaScript & jQuery, SCSS, BEM methodology, Bootstrap CSS
* **Backend:** Custom WordPress theme (PHP), Advanced Custom Fields (ACF Pro), Custom Post Types

### 🌟 Key Features & Technical Highlights

#### 1. Custom post architecture
Unlike standard blogs, this site relies on a customized WordPress structure.
* **Custom post types:** Built from the ground up to handle "Trips" as a separate entity with unique metadata (price, itinerary etc.)

#### 2. Full editorial control (ACF)
I created a flexible system where the client can edit website content without touching a single line of code.

#### 3. Unique custom WordPress theme
I created a unique custom WordPress theme that provides original design and functionality.

### 💡 Challenges & Solutions

* **UX for large data sets:** With hundreds of offers, the main challenge was preventing "choice paralysis". I cooperated with the designer and implemented a clean, card-based UI with clear visual hierarchies (trip title, description, price, what is included, etc.). I also focused heavily on **Mobile-First design**, as many teachers browse these offers on tablets or phones.
